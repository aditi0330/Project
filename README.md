# Deep Learning Project
## Implementing a Fully Convolutional Neural Network from scratch and comparing different architectures for flowers recognition dataset for Image Classification.
### Requirements
#### Using packages
Keras (tensorflow.python.keras) for building models
OpenCV (cv2) for processing images
sikit-learn (sklearn) for train_test_split
